# SET

My online version of the SET card game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)), following the original logic & timed.

## Built with:
** TypeScript /	React /	SASS / **

## Motivation
It's my pet project. As a person who loves games, I wanted to recreate one of my personal favourites.

## Demo:
You can see the project and play (in the training mode for now) here:

## Structure & features 

[to be updated]

## Current status & planned development

Main features are ready, but the project is still in progress. Main areas for development: 

1. RWD - adjustments to the mobile view
2. New playing mode: play against the computer (currently the game is only available in the training mode)
3. Result-saving (with Firebase)
4. Tutorial mode (comments that help the player learn to spot sets when playing)
